# What's Happening

An event planner for everyone!  
 - Event planners can organize events for a  predefined list of venues, invite attendees to your event.
 - Event goers can search for events they want to go to and "reserve" the ones they want to attend.  

Event search not only searches all the events created within What's Happening, it also searches Ticketmaster using the Ticketmaster Discovery API v2
